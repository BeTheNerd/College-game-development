========================

Team Updates,

Physics Library has still not been decided,
Task's have not been assigned to members yet,
Game Idea have been agreed upon but not confirmed with all members,
To Use the Game Engine Create a New Activity and inherit it from the Old Existing AndroidGame Activity.


Project Updates,

Game Engine Rolled Back To Original, 
Refactored implemention folder to implementation (Spelling Error),
It may have broken the android program, but I believe the xml manifest still might need to be changed anyway.
I have not attempted to fix it as I don't I am not 100% certain about the changes I need to make.

Updated PDF, Still only 2 Chapters Available, will update it when more are released,





Zaki,
